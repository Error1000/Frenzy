NOOP  0x0 # Immediate ignored
TOA   0x1 # Immediate is address
TOB   0x2 # Immediate is address
SUM   0x3 # Immediate ignored
SUB   0x4 # Immediate ignored
FROMA 0x5 # Immediate is address
FROMB 0x6 # Immediate is address
JMP   0x7 # Immediate ignored
CHNGA 0x8 # Immediate has special meaning
CHNGB 0x9 # Immediate has special meaning
AND   0xA # Immediate ignored


CHNGA and CHNGB possible immediates:
DEC, INC, INV, SET0, SETFF, SETLB0, SETLB1, NEG
0     1   2    3     4      5        6      7



JMPC  0xE # Immediate ignored
JMPZ  0xF # Immediate ignored

JMP, JMPC and JMPZ will jump to the address in the next address to them in ram

/*
DEC, INC, INV, SET0, SETFF, SETLB0, SETLB1, NEG
0     1   2    3     4      5        6      7

Normally: 1. no LOAD, 2. LOAD
and these:
CASCADEMOD, CLKMOD, DEF, INMOD
SET0:   0, 0, 0, 0
SETFF:  0, 0, 1, 0
INV:    0, 0, 1, 1
SETLB1: 0, 1, 1, 0 // CLKMOD is on, and DEF = 1, hopefully OR1 without sidefects
INC:    0, 1, 1, 1
SETLB0: 1, 1, 0, 0 // CLKMOD = 1, but no INMOD, so this basically means all ops only affect the first bit
DEC:    1, 1, 1, 1

Except for NEG:
where 1. no CLKMOD, 2. CLKMOD
DEF, LOAD, INMOD
